Port old code for formats:
	- Archives:
		- EXE
		- Melty Blood
		- NPA (S;G)
		- NSA
		- RGSSAD
		- XP3 (F/SN, CXDEC)
		- YKC

	- Files:
		- Fortune Summoners

		- YKG
		- MSD
		- YKS

C++ stuff:
	- Port IO to classes
	- Port VirtualFile to class
	- Port Image to class
	- Port Sound to class
	- Try to minify string_ex usages
	- Remove stdbool includes
	- Review all includes
	- Replace pointers with references where applicable to reduce assertions
	- Carefully check out smart pointers
	- Replace logging with exceptions

Unit tests (low priority):
	- NPA archive
	- PAK archive
	- MGD - choose a non-monochrome image for tests; fix possible RGB-BGR issues

Misc:
	- Improve incorrect --fmt handling
	- Replace some assertions with explicit checks

The ride never ends!
